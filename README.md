# What is WorkingOverFlow?
This is the Sketch Library to create some awesome arrows that it will help everyone so much in orgranizational workflow on Sketch.

# How to install
I have created this library based on Sketch file. So this is just a Sketchfile, you can overview this file and copy what part you want to use in your project. From Sketch 47, you can use a Sketchfile as well as a library and symbols. Here is the link [how to install libraries](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/adding-libraries) from Sketch, just in case for the people who have just used Sketch.
